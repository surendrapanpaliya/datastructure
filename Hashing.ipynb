    "\n",
    "    1.Hash Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A function that takes a key and returns an integer, usually the index where the corresponding value is stored in the hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: hash(key) = index\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.Hash Table:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A data structure that stores the key-value pairs, where each key maps to a unique value.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The size of the hash table is typically much smaller than the number of possible keys, so the hash function compresses the key space into a smaller space of possible indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.Collisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A collision occurs when two different keys hash to the same index in the hash table. This is handled using techniques like chaining or open addressing."

    "Why Use Hashing?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hashing is used to provide fast access to data. It is widely used in scenarios where efficient data retrieval is required. The main advantages of using hashing are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Fast Lookups:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hashing allows for constant time complexity on average for common operations like search, insert, and delete operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Operations like retrieving a value using its key can typically be done in O(1) time, which is much faster than searching through a list or tree, which can take O(n) or O(logn).\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Efficient Memory Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hash tables allow efficient use of memory because they use an array to store data, and only a small portion of memory is used at a time, depending on the hash function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hashing is especially useful when dealing with large amounts of data because it organizes the data efficiently for quick access.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Associative Mapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hashing provides a way to map keys to values. This makes it easy to build associative data structures like hash maps or dictionaries where each key is unique, and it is used to quickly access the corresponding value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Collision Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Even when two keys map to the same index, hashing uses collision resolution techniques (like chaining, open addressing) to manage the conflicts, ensuring efficient access even in these cases."

    "Quadratic Probing for Hash Collision Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "    Quadratic Probing is a collision resolution technique used in hash tables to handle situations where two or more keys hash to the same index (collision). \n",
    "\n",
    "    Instead of searching for the next available slot linearly (as in linear probing), quadratic probing uses a quadratic function to determine the interval between probes.\n",

    "    Reduces Clustering: Quadratic probing helps reduce primary clustering, which is a problem in linear probing where contiguous blocks of filled slots lead to more collisions.\n",

    "Explanation of Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Hash Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The hash function computes the index by applying the hash() function to the key and taking the result modulo the size of the hash table. This ensures that the index falls within the bounds of the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Chaining for Collision Resolution:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Each bucket in the hash table points to the head of a linked list (represented by HashNode). When a collision occurs (i.e., two keys hash to the same index), the new key-value pair is added to the linked list at that index.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.Insertion:\n",
    "     When inserting, if the key already exists in the hash table, its value is updated. Otherwise, a new node is added to the beginning of the linked list at the appropriate index.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.Search:\n",
    "    The search() method traverses the linked list at the given index to find the key. If the key is found, its associated value is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    5.Deletion:\n",
    "    The delete() method removes the node associated with the given key from the hash table. It handles cases where the node is the first in the list or is in the middle/end.\n",
    "\n",
    "    6.Display:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The display() method prints the contents of the hash table, showing each bucket and its linked list of key-value pairs."
