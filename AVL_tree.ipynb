    "This AVL tree insertion code ensures that after every insertion, the tree remains balanced by adjusting the heights and performing rotations when necessary. The balance factor of each node is checked after insertion, and the appropriate rotation is performed depending on whether the imbalance is LL, RR, LR, or RL.\n",

    "Each case restores the balance of the tree, ensuring that the AVL tree maintains a height of O(log n) and provides efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations."
