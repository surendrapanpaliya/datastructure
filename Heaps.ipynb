    "Explanation of Each Step:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Negating the Values to Simulate a Max-Heap:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In Python, the heapq module implements a min-heap by default, where the smallest element is at the root. To create a max-heap, we insert the negative of each element from the input array into the heap. This makes the smallest negative value behave as the largest positive value, simulating a max-heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    array = [10, 3, 15]\n",
    "    max_heap = [-10, -3, -15]  # Insert negated values to simulate max-heap\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Heapifying the List:\n",
    "    •\tAfter negating the values, we use heapq.heapify() to convert the list into a valid heap structure. This operation ensures that the smallest (most negative) value is at the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    heapq.heapify(max_heap)\n",
    "    print(max_heap)  # Output: [-15, -3, -10]  # simulates a max-heap with root as 15\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Extracting the Maximum Element:\n",
    "    •\tWe repeatedly extract the largest element (which is stored as the smallest negative value in the heap) using heapq.heappop(). After extracting the element, we negate it back to its original positive form and add it to the sorted list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    largest_element = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)  # Get max element (positive form)\n",
    "    sorted_array.append(largest_element)        # Append to sorted list\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Building the Sorted Array:\n",
    "    •\tEach time we extract the largest element from the heap, we append it to the sorted_array. By repeatedly extracting the largest element, the heap size reduces, and eventually, the entire array becomes sorted in ascending order.\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    sorted_array = [23, 18, 15, 10, 8, 7, 3]  # Output of heap sort\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example Run:\n",
    "    unsorted_array = [10, 3, 15, 7, 8, 23, 74, 18]\n",
    "    sorted_array = heap_sort(unsorted_array)\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(f\"Unsorted Array: {unsorted_array}\")  # Unsorted Array: [10, 3, 15, 7, 8, 23, 74, 18]\n",
    "    print(f\"Sorted Array: {sorted_array}\")      # Sorted Array: [3, 7, 8, 10, 15, 18, 23, 74]\n",
    "\n",
    "    Time Complexity:\n",
    "    •\tBuilding the heap: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array.\n",
    "    •\tHeap operations (insertion and deletion): O(log n) per operation.\n",
    "    •\tExtracting elements: We extract n elements, and each extraction takes O(log n).\n",
    "    Thus, the total time complexity is O(n log n).\n",
    "    Space Complexity:\n",
    "    •\tThe space complexity is O(n) because we use an additional list (max_heap) to store the negated values of the input array, and another list (sorted_array) to store the sorted elements.\n",
    "    Summary of Heap Sort:\n",
    "    •\tHeap Sort uses the heap data structure to sort elements in O(n log n) time.\n",
    "    •\tWe use a max-heap (simulated by negating values in a min-heap) to extract the largest element repeatedly and build a sorted array.\n",
    "    •\tHeap Sort is in-place when using a heap data structure directly, but the Python implementation here is not truly in-place due to the use of additional lists.\n",
    "    Heap Sort is especially useful when you need a sorting algorithm with good time complexity guarantees, and its heap-based structure is a good fit for priority queues, scheduling tasks, and other applications where efficiently managing the minimum or maximum value is critical."
